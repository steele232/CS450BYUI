# Notes on Week 11 - Ensemble

Used Data from weeks 4 (including the preprocessed data)

Also used some examples from GoLearn to get that running.

When I found that the GoLearn RandomForest didn't perform well on Iris, I decided to compare it against the SKLearn RandomForest, so that's why I used an "easy" dataset.
